**Introduction**

This is the code base for our HCI Project. The UI/UX we chose to redesign is craigslist.org. Craigslist is a fairly dated website that specializes in advertising community, services, jobs, housing etc.
The tech stack we designed this website on is the basic web development stack: HTML, CSS, JS. We also incorporated some open source technologies including Bootstrap v5.3. Boostrap v5.3 offers a lot of
responsive elements, features and components that web developers can easily used. We used this to add features such as buttons, dropdowns, accordions etc and to create a responsive grid to base our website on.
Another open source that helped us a lot was codepen.io. Codepen is a website where developers can post their interesting code snippets for free use. We incorporated many elements using this with minor modifications and any features are cited in the code.
